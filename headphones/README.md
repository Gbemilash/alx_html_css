This project implements a fully responsive, accessible, and pixel-perfect webpage based on a Figma design by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer.

## Overview

The objective was to recreate the provided Figma design **from scratch**, using only HTML and CSS, with no external frameworks or JavaScript. The page must:

- Accurately reflect the Figma design on desktop (max width 1000px centered)
- Adapt responsively for mobile screens (<= 480px)
- Use proper semantic HTML5 elements
- Implement accessible features (aria attributes, alt tags, focus states, etc.)
- Use only the fonts **Source Sans Pro** and **Spin Cycle OT** (downloaded and self-hosted)
- Include interactive states for links and buttons:
  - Links: hover and active color changes to `#FF6565`
  - Buttons: hover and active opacity change to `0.9`
